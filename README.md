# airbnb-clone-project

Welcome to the **AirBnB Clone Project** â€“ a full-stack booking and property management system inspired by AirBnB. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a modern web application with a clean UI/UX, robust functionality, and scalable architecture.

## Project Goals
By completing this project, I will:
- Understand the end-to-end development lifecycle of a booking platform.
- Implement key features like property listings, search, and booking management.
- Gain proficiency in **React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Django**.
- Collaborate effectively in a team with defined roles (Frontend, Backend, QA, etc.).
- Deliver a production-ready application within a structured timeline.

##  Features
- **Property Listings**: Browse properties with images, prices, and descriptions.
- **Detailed Property View**: See amenities, location, and availability.
- **Booking System**: Select dates, guests, and complete reservations.
- **Search & Filters**: Find properties by location, price, or availability.
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup/login for guests and hosts.

##  Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript** for type-safe components.
- **Next.js** for SSR/SSG and optimized routing.
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive, utility-first styling.
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API.
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library.

### Backend (Illustrative)
- **Python** + **Django** (REST API).
- **MySQL** for database management.
- **Authentication**: JWT/OAuth.
