## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
1. **User-Friendly Flow**: Intuitive navigation from browsing to booking.  
2. **Visual Consistency**: Cohesive colors, typography, and spacing.  
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant contrast and keyboard navigation.  

### Key Pages
| Page                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing**  | Grid of property cards with filters (price, location, amenities).           |
| **Detailed View**     | High-res images, amenity icons, interactive map, and booking widget.        |
| **Checkout View**     | Minimalist form with date picker, price summary, and payment gateway.       |

### Design Properties
- **Colors**:  
  - Primary: `#FF5A5F` (AirBnB-inspired coral)  
  - Secondary: `#008489` (teal for accents)  
  - Neutral: `#F7F7F7` (light gray background)  
- **Typography**:  
  - Font Family: `Inter` (sans-serif)  
  - Headings: `600` weight, `24pxâ€“32px` size  
  - Body Text: `400` weight, `16px` size  

**Why It Matters**:  
Identifying these properties early ensures design consistency across components and avoids redundant styling efforts.

## API Security

### Key Measures
1. **Authentication**  
   - JWT tokens with short expiration times  
   - Why: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts  

2. **Authorization**  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)  
   - Why: Ensures hosts can't modify others' properties  

3. **Rate Limiting**  
   - 100 requests/minute per IP via Nginx  
   - Why: Prevents brute force/DDoS attacks  

4. **Data Validation**  
   - Input sanitization + prepared statements  
   - Why: Blocks SQL injection and XSS attacks  

5. **Payment Security**  
   - PCI-compliant Stripe integration  
   - Why: Protects sensitive financial data
